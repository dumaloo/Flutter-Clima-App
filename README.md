# Clima ☁

Welcome to Clima, your go-to weather app for checking real-time weather information for any city and your current location! This app is inspired by the beautiful designs created by [Olia Gozha](https://dribbble.com/shots/4663154-).

## About Clima

Clima is a Flutter-based weather application that leverages the Open Weather API to provide you with accurate and up-to-date weather data. With Clima, you can:

- Get real-time weather information for your current location.
- Retrieve weather details for any city by searching with its name.
- Receive clothing recommendations based on the current temperature in Celsius.

- **City Search:** Want to know the weather in another city? Just type in the city name, and Clima will fetch the latest weather data for you.

- **Wardrobe Suggestions:** Clima goes beyond providing weather stats; it offers clothing recommendations based on the temperature, ensuring you're dressed appropriately for the day.
